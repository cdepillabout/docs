- electric field: the field created by charge particles which exerts a force on 
  other charge particles.  Electric fields propogate through air, but travel 
  even better through conductive materials.

- magnetic field: the field created by moving charge particles or time-varying 
  electric fields which exerts a force on other moving charge particles.

- voltage: the difference in electrical potential between two locations, which 
  is equal to the integral of the electric field and changing magnetic fields.

  The voltage associated with a circuit element is the energy transferred per 
  unit of charge that flows through the element. The units of voltage are volts 
  (V), which are equivalent to joules per coulomb (J/C).  For example, consider 
  the storage battery of an automobile.  The voltage across the terminals is 
  12V.  This means that 12 J are transfered to or from the battery for each 
  coulomb that flows through it.

  Voltages are assigned polarities that indicate the direction of energy flow.  
  If positive charge moves from the positive polarity through the element 
  toward the negative polarity, the element absorbs energy that appears as 
  heat, mechanical energy, stored chemical energy, or as some other form. If 
  positive charge moves from the negative polarity toward the positive 
  polarity, the element supplies energy.

- current: the quantity of charge particles moving along a path, typically a 
  wire.

  Electrical current is the time rate of flow of electrical charge through a 
  conductor or circuit element.  The units are amperes (A), which are 
  equivalent to coulombs per second (C/s).

  In equations, current is often denoted as an italic i.

- power: the rate of energy transfer or consumption.
  
  Because the current (i) is the rate of flow of charge and the voltage (v) is 
  a measure of the energy transferred per unit of charge, the product of the 
  current and the voltage is the rate of energy transfer.  So, p = vi.

  Power is denoted by W, for watts.
  
- electron: the subatomic negatively charged particle that usually creates a 
  current.

- capacitance

- resistor: convert electrical energy into heat.  This resists the flow of 
  current.

- capacitor: constructed by separating two sheets of conductor, which is 
  usually metallic, by a thin layer of insulating material. This stores energy 
  as an electric field.

- inductor: constructed by coiling a wire around some type of form.  This 
  stores energy as a magnetic field.

- diode: only allow current to flow in one direction. can convert ac to dc. all 
  diodes emit radiation (usually infrared), but some light emitting diodes 
  (LEDs) are designed to produce visible light.

- operational amplifier (op-amp, OP-amp, etc.): provide robust, stable 
  amplification of an input signal.

- Ohm’s Law (V = IR): The voltage (v) across an ideal resistor is proportional 
  to the current (i) through the resistor.  The constant of this 
  proportionality is the resistance (R).  The unit of resistance is V/A, or 
  ohms.

- Power (P = IV)

- Kirchoff’s current law: the net entering a node is zero.  To compute the net 
  current, we add the currents entering and subtract the currents leaving.

- Resistors in series: They have their resistance added together, to get an 
  equivalent resistance.  So, Req = E(Ri)

- Resistors in parallel: Their equivalent resistance the inverse of the sum of 
  the inverse of the resistances in parallel, so Req = 1 / (E(1/Ri)). Two 
  resistors in parallel just become Req = (R1 * R2) / (R1 + R2).
