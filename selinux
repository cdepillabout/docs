# Users 
# The SELinux user is not equivalent to a Linux user. One significant
# difference between the SELinux users and Linux users is SELinux users do
# not change during a user session, whereas a Linux user might change via
# su or sudo. Typically many Linux users will use the same SELinux user,
# but it is possible to have a 1:1 Linux user to SELinux user mapping,
# such as the root Linux user and the root SELinux user. By convention,
# SELinux users that are generic have the suffix "_u", such as user_u.

# Roles 
# A SELinux user may be allowed to take on one or more
# roles. What a role means is defined by the policy, but examples of
# roles are an unprivileged user, a web administrator, and a database
# administrator. Objects typically have the role object_r. By convention,
# roles have the suffix "_r", such as user_r.

# Types 
# This is the primary means of determining access (this will be
# further discussed later). The type of a process is also referred to as
# its domain. By convention, a type has the suffix "_t", such as user_t.


# You can use the semanage program to get information about the system.

# get the mapping of login names (actual users on your system) to 
# SELinux users.
semanage login -l

# get the mapping of selinux users to selinux roles
semanage user -l


# SELinux has many object classes (categories of objects), such as dir for
# directories and file for files. These are used in the policy and in access
# decisions to more finely specify what access is allowed. Each object
# class has a set of permissions which are the possible ways to access
# these objects. For example, the file object class has the permissions
# create, read, write, and unlink (delete), while the unix_stream_socket
# object class (UNIX domain stream sockets) has the permissions create,
# connect, and sendto.


# The primary security mechanism of SELinux is type enforcement, meaning
# that rules are specified using the type of the process and object:
# 
#	allow user_t user_home_t:file { create read write unlink };
# 
# This rule states that the user_t type is allowed to create, read, write,
# and delete files with the user_home_t type. More information on adding
# rules to the policy will be covered in other pages.



# this changes the context of a file temporarily
chcon -t user_home_t /tmp/myfile

# this changes the context of a file persistently across reboots
semanage fcontext -a -t user_home_t /var/cache/myfile 
restorecon /var/cache/myfile 

# this runs a new shell with a new context
newrole -r system_r -t unconfined_t

# change the context of a program when started
# (this is only temporary)
runcon system_u:system_r:crond_t /bin/bash

# reset the context of a file
restorecon /tmp/myfile


# change the mode from permissive to enforcing
echo 1 > /selinux/enforce
# or
setenforce 1

# change the mode from enforcing to permissive
echo 0 > /selinux/enforce
# or
setenforce 0


# You can also add the kernel parameter "enforcing=0"
# to put it into permissive mode or "enforcing=1" to put it
# into enforcing mode.  You can use the kernel param "selinux=0"
# to disable selinux or "selinux=1" to enable selinux.
# Setting the mode at the command line overrides the modes
# set in /etc/selinux/config


# run_init can be used to start services in the same domain as they 
# would have as if they were brought up as part of the normal bootup process.
run_init /etc/init.d/sshd start


# Install a new module
semodule -i new_module.pp

# To make your own modules manually, cp the Makefile from
# /usr/share/doc/selinux-base-policy-20061008/Makefile.example.gz 
# into a temporary dir. If your .te file is called "local.te", you
# can make your local.pp and load it by running this command:
make && semodule -u local.pp && semodule -l
# This page will show you how to make it the local.te:
