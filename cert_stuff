# NSS stores it's certificates and private keys in a security database
# unlike OpenSSL which references it's certificates and keys via file
# pathnames. This means unless you already have an NSS Certificate Database
# (CertDB) the first order of business will be to create one. When a NSS
# application initializes itself it will need to specify the path to the
# CertDB (see "Things All NSS programs must do").
# 
# The CertDB is created and manipulated by the command line utilities
# certutil and modutil. Both of these programs are part of the
# nss-tools RPM. Documentation for these tools can be found here:
# http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/tools
# 
# Here is an example of creating a CertDB and populating it. In the example
# the CertDB will be created under the directory "./pki", the CA will be
# called "myca", the database password will be "myca", and the server's
# hostname will be "myhost.example.com".


# Create the database.  This has to be done before everything else, if you 
# don't already have a database.  "-N" means to create the database.
certutil -N -d ./pki
# This creates a new database under the directory ./pki


# 2. Create a root CA certificate. "-S" means to make a certificate
# and add it to the database. "-s" specifies the subject, "-n" 
# specifies the nickname of the cert, "-x" means that is it self-signed
# (it must be, since it is a Root CA and we are creating it ourselves), 
# "-t" gives the trust arguments, and "-m" gives the serial number 
# (I don't think the serial number is really needed, it specifies the
# index this certificate is in the security database; it does not 
# have any effect on the actual certificate, only on the database).
certutil -d ./pki -S -s "CN=myca" -n myca -x -t "CTu,C,C" -m 1
# This creates an individual certificate and adds it to the certificate
# database with a subject of "CN=myca", a nickname of "myca", trust flags
# indicating for SSL indicating it can issue server certificates (C),
# can issue client certificates (T), and the certificate can be used for
# authentication and signing (u). For email and object signing it's trusted
# to create server certificates. The certificate serial number is set to 1.


# 3. Create a server certificate and sign it. "-c" gives the nickname of 
# the cert that will sign this new certificate.
certutil -d pki -S -c myca -s "CN=myhost.example.com" -n myhost -t "C,C,C" -m 2
# This creates an individual certificate issued by the CA "myca" and adds
# it to the certificate database with a subject of "CN=myhost.example.com",
# a nickname of "myhost". The certificate serial number is set to 2.


# 4. Import public root CA's:
modutil -add ca_certs -libfile /usr/lib/libnssckbi.so -dbdir ./pki
# This is necessary to verify certificates presented by a SSL server a NSS
# client might connect to. When verifying a certificate the NSS library will
# "walk the certificate chain" back to a root CA which must be trusted. This
# command imports the well known root CA's as a PKCS #11 module.


# lots of good info
# http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/tools/certutil.html


# show certs in cert database.  Database is located in current directory.
certutil -L -d .

# show keys in key database
certutil -K -d .

# list modules in secmod database
modutil -list -dbdir .
# SSL communicates with PKCS #11 modules through the PKCS #11
# interface. Any PKCS #11 module that supports PKCS #11 can be used with
# the NSS libraries. Netscape software uses a file called secmod.db to
# keep track of the modules available. A PKCS #11 module always has one
# or more slots, which may be implemented as physical hardware slots
# in some form of physical reader (for example, for smart cards) or as
# conceptual slots in software. Each slot for a PKCS #11 module can in turn
# contain a token, which is the hardware or software device that actually
# provides cryptographic services and optionally stores certificates and
# keys. Netscape provides three built-in modules with NSS and with server
# and client products:
# The default Netscape Internal PKCS #11 Module comes with two built-in tokens:
# 	- The Generic Crypto Services token performs all cryptographic
# 	  operations, such as encryption, decryption, and hashing.
# 	- The Communicator Certificate DB token handles all communication
# 	  with the certificate and key database files (called certX.db and
# 	  keyX.db, respectively, where X is a version number) that store
# 	  certificates and keys.


# Save a certificate in a .crt file in ascii encoding.
certutil -L -d ./pki -n "myca" -a -o CA_db/rootca.crt


# Create pk12 cert from nss database.
# This can be used with openssl.
pk12util -o staca.p12 -n STACA  -d ../certdb/
