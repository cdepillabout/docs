# This gives you permission to open windows on the X-server and use it. (if you opened 
# it from the console (`X :1 &`)
xauth add :0 . `mcookie`

# you can open programs like so:
xterm -display :1 &

# a virtual X-server in an X-window
# (this is pretty cool)
Xnest :3 -scrns 2 &
xauth add :3 . `mcookie`
xterm -display :3.0 -bg red
xterm -display :3.1 -bg blue

# You can run the X-server on one machine and the connecting X-clients on another
# On the first machine (192.168.0.1) start the X-server using “startx”, then ensure a window 
# manager is running. In the “xterm” window enter the command:
# ( you probably shouldn't use this because it's not really secure )
xhost add 192.168.0.2

# on the second machine, from a console, enter the command
xterm -display 192.168.0.1:0 &


# from http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/494

$ xauth list $DISPLAY
#You'll get something like

#somehost.somedomain:10 mit-magic-cookie-1 4d22408a71a55b41ccd1657d377923ae

#Then, after having done su, tell the new user what the cookie is:

$ xauth add somehost.somedomain:10 MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 4d22408a71a55b41ccd1657d377923ae

# set up two screens
xrandr --output LVDS --auto --output VGA --auto


# display information about an X server
xdpyinfo

# check screen info
xrandr
