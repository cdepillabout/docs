#### THIS IS FOR THE STANDARD OS FROM THE CD ####

# run test suite (as user "bin")
cd /usr/src/test
make
./run

# Rebuild the entire operating system

# see the options available
cd /usr/src/tools
make

# rebuild os?
su
make clean
time make image
make hdboot


#### THIS IS FOR UPDATING FROM THE SUBVERSION REPOSITORY ####

# get sources
cd /usr
svn --username username checkout https://gforge.cs.vu.nl/svn/minix/trunk/src

# update sources
cd /usr/src
svn update

# rebuild (may have to update files in /etc and /usr/src/etc manually)
cd /usr/src
make world

# Make world does nothing with the 'etc files'. Sometimes it may 
# be necessary to get new or updated etc files. There is no 
# automated procedure for this, though. Compare files in 
# src/etc and /etc and see if any updates have happened.


# To boot your new image, see that your 'image' boot environment 
# variable is set to '/boot/image' (the default). This means the 
# newest image from /boot/image will be booted.
# You should check to make sure that the just-installed image does
# indeed have the newest modification time. If that is all in order, 
# reboot your system by saying:
reboot


# The above procedure doesn't take the rebuilding required 
# for the system libraries for GCC into account. If you have 
# GCC installed, you can update your system libraries in 
# /usr/gnu/lib by doing this, as bin:
PATH=$PATH:/usr/gnu/bin
make clean all-gnu install-gnu
