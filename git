# your own branches and is safe to do without changing your working copy. 
# A "git pull" is what you would do to bring your repository up to date with 
# a remote repository.

# If you add some things to .gitignore, and you are wondering if it
# masks files that are already in the repo, you can check with a command like this:

# To set up a remote git repository, you can do something like this:
# (This will be the git repo on the server)
mkdir example.git
cd example.git
# to share with the group...

# or have the repo all to yourself (git uses permissions reported by umask)
git init --bare 

# Then we create our local repo and commit to the server

# Git has a staging area for code before you commit.
# The staging area is also referred to as the index.
# This will add something that will be commited on the next commit.
git add somefile.txt
# Only add some changes in this file to the staging area.
git add --patch somefile.txt
# You can check the diffs of the files in the staging area.
# (without the --cached, it will display the diffs of the unstaged
#  or working copy of the files)
git diff --cached
# Then, commit the changes that have been staged.
# By default git-commit stores the current contents of the index in a 
# new commit along with the log message from the user.  (But if you 
# give git-commit some files as arguments, commit will ignore the changes
# staged in the index, and instead record the current contents of the listed
# files.  Giving the -a switch will automatically "add" all changes from all 
# known files.)
git commit -m "Fix some bad stuff with the files that have been staged."

# git-add actually does everything you could want with the staging area,
# so a more powerful command to run is with --interactive.
# git-add is your interface for modifing the staging area.
git add --interactive


# After a merge (initiated by git merge or git pull) stops because of conflicts, cleanly merged paths are
# already staged to be committed for you, and paths that conflicted are left in unmerged state. You would
# have to first check which paths are conflicting with git status and after fixing them manually in your
# working tree, you would stage the result as usual with git add
git status | grep unmerged
# The output will be "unmerged: hello.c".
# You need to edit this file to fix the conflicts.
(edit hello.c)
# Then you can add this file to your index and then commit it.
git add hello.c
# After resolving conflicts and staging the result, git ls-files -u would stop mentioning the conflicted
# path. When you are done, run git commit to finally record the merge:
git commit


# Create a new branch from "some_other_branch" and check it out immediately.
git checkout -b my_new_branch some_other_branch


# If you make some changes in one branch, but you made a mistake, and actually
# wanted to make those changes in another branch, you can  use this command to 
# switch branches (to "some_other_branch") and carry over the changes in your 
# working copy and in your index to the new branch.
git checkout -m some_other_branch

##########################
# Examples using git-reset
##########################

#
# 1) Undo a commit and redo
#
git commit ...
# This is most often done when you remembered what you just committed is incomplete, or you
# misspelled your commit message, or both. Leaves working tree as it was before "reset".
# Doesn't mess with your working copy or with the index.
git reset --soft HEAD^
# edit some files...
(edit some files...)
# "reset" copies the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD; redo the commit by starting with its log message.
# If you do not need to edit the message further, you can give -C option instead.
git commit -a -c ORIG_HEAD

# Takes the changes staged in the index and squashes them into the previous
# commit. This lets you fix a problem with the last commit, which is almost 
# always where you see the technique prescribed, but it also opens up the 
# option of a commit-heavy workflow where you continuously revise and annotate 
# whatever it is you’re working on.
# This is an easy way to do the previous resetting and committing.
git commit --amend


#
# 2) Undo commits permanently
#
git commit ...
# The last three commits (HEAD, HEAD^, and HEAD~2) were bad and you do not want to ever see them
# again. Do not do this if you have already given these commits to somebody else.
# With this, you lose your working copy and the index.
git reset --hard HEAD~3


#
# 3) Undo a commit, making it a topic branch
#
# You have made some commits, but realize they were premature to be in the "master" branch. You
# want to continue polishing them in a topic branch, so create "topic/wip" branch off of the current
# HEAD.
git branch topic/wip
# Rewind the master branch to get rid of those three commits.
git reset --hard HEAD~3
# Switch to "topic/wip" branch and keep working.
git checkout topic/wip


#
# 4) Undo add
#
# You edit some files and add them to the index to be committed. You
# do not want to see them when you run "git diff", because you plan 
# to work on other files and changes with these files are distracting.
git add frotz.c filfre.c
# Somebody asks you to pull, and the changes sounds worthy of merging.
# However, you already dirtied the index (i.e. your index does not match 
# the HEAD commit). But you know the pull you are going to make does not 
# affect frotz.c nor filfre.c, so you revert the index changes for these 
# two files. Your changes in working tree remain there.
git reset
# Now you can pull. Leaving the frotz.c and filfre.c changes still in the
# working tree.
git pull git://info.example.com/ nitfol


#
# 5) Undo a merge or pull
#
# A pull results in a lot of conflicts.
$ git pull
Auto-merging nitfol
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in nitfol
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
# You don't want to deal with it now, so you need to reset everything back
# to the state in which you had it. "pull" has not made merge commit, 
# so "git reset --hard" (which is a synonym for "git reset --hard HEAD") 
# clears the mess from the index file and the working tree.
$ git reset --hard


#
# 6) Undo a merge or pull
#
# Merge a topic branch into the current branch, 
# which resulted in a fast-forward.
$ git pull . topic/branch
Updating from 41223... to 13134...
Fast-forward
# But you decided that the topic branch is not ready for public consumption 
# yet. "pull" or "merge" always leaves the original tip of the current 
# branch in ORIG_HEAD, so resetting hard to it brings your index file 
# and the working tree back to that state, and resets the tip of the 
# branch to that commit.
$ git reset --hard ORIG_HEAD


# 
# 7) Interrupted workflow
#
# Suppose you are interrupted by an urgent fix request while you are in
# the middle of a large change.  The files in your working tree are not in
# any shape to be committed yet, but you need to get to the other branch
# for a quick bugfix.
$ git checkout feature ;# you were working in "feature" branch and
$ work work work       ;# got interrupted
# This is just like a snapshot that you will restore and then blow away later
$ git commit -a -m "snapshot WIP"
# Now go to master and fix the problem.
$ git checkout master
$ fix fix fix
$ git commit ;# commit with real log
# Now go back to feature for the stuff you were working on.
$ git checkout feature
# This removes the commit with the message "snapshot WIP",
# and sets your working tree to the state just before you made
# the snapshot.
$ git reset --soft HEAD^ ;# go back to WIP state
# At this point the index file still has all the WIP changes 
# you committed as snapshot WIP. This updates the index to 
# show your WIP files as uncommitted.
$ git reset


# This can also be done much easier with git-stash.
# 
$ (edit the files you were working on)
# Stash the changes in those files away
$ git stash
# Edit a different set of files.
$ (edit emergency fix)
$ git commit -a -m "Fix in a hurry"
# Now get those changes back that you had stashed.
$ git stash pop


#
# 8) Reset a single file in the index
# 
# Suppose you have added a file to your index, but later decide you
# do not want to add it to your commit. You can remove the file from the
# index while keeping your changes with git reset.
#
# This removes the file from the index while keeping it 
# in the working directory.
git reset -- frotz.c
# Commit all other changes in the index.
git commit -m "Commit files in index"
# Adds the file to the index again.
git add frotz.c



#
# Simple stuff with stash -- Pulling into a dirty tree
#
# When you are in the middle of something, you learn that there are upstream
# changes that are possibly relevant to what you are doing. When your local
# changes do not conflict with the changes in the upstream, a simple git
# pull will let you move forward.
# 
# However, there are cases in which your local changes do conflict with
# the upstream changes, and git pull refuses to overwrite your changes. In
# such a case, you can stash your changes away, perform a pull, and then
# unstash, like this:
$ git pull
...
file foobar not up to date, cannot merge.
$ git stash
$ git pull
$ git stash pop




# Change some commits in the past. (This goes back 10 commits.)
# You can delete, squash, edit, and reorder commits.
git rebase --interactive HEAD~10


# Create a remote tracking branch.  When branches are created
# using the --track option, they will be set up to linked to the remote
# branch. From here you can git checkout the branch and work with it,
# and since it’s tracking the remote branch, it will know where to
# bring in changes from when you fetch or pull.
git branch --track new_branch origin/some_branch

# show where things get pushed to and pulled from per remote.
git remote -v show REMOTE_NAME
# so this should normally be something like this:
git remote -v show origin



# get's changes from your remote
git fetch 
# show changes between your current stuff, and the stuff you will merge in.
git log -p HEAD..FETCH_HEAD


# Ignore changes in files that are already committed to the repository
git update-index --assume-unchanged FILENAME


# Merge in changes from a branch, but just leave them as changes to be commited
# in the next commit.
git merge --squash someotherbranch

# - the index refers to the set of newly created trees and blobs which you
#	created by running `git add`. These new objects will soon get bound into a
#	new tree for the purpose of committing to your repository, but until then,
#	they are only referenced by the index.

# In .git/objects/*, there are all the objects git knows about.
# In order to get the type of an object, you can use a command like this
git cat-file -t 7b06b409

# If this is a commit, you can list the changelog message with a command like this
git cat-file commit 7b06b409

# if this object is a tree, or to list the tree from a commit, use this command
