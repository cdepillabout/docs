# make some changes to the files in your repository...
# then, commit those changes to your repository
git commit -a

# push those changes to the server.
# We are pushing to our remote origin's master branch
git push origin master


# create new branch called experimental
git branch experimental

git checkout experimental

# push a local branch to your remote repository

# On github, there is a public clone url and your own clone url.
# The public clone url looks like git://github.com/...
# but your own clone url looks like git@github.com/... (this uses ssh)
# Cloning either one is the same, but if it's the public url, you
# can't push to it.

# clone or copy a repository from github (after you've forked it to your account --
# that's why the name is cdepillabout)
git clone git@github.com:cdepillabout/merb-core.git
# add their directory as a place you can pull from
git remote add wycats git://github.com/wycats/merb-core.git

# 1
# go back to your copy
git checkout master
# get their latest copy and automatically merge
git pull wycats master

# OR

# 2
# go back to your copy
git checkout master
# get their latest updates
git fetch wycats
# manually merge
git merge wycats/master



# set up aliases
git config --global alias.co checkout


# ignore certain files
# Create a file in the root directory called ".gitignore and add some files to it

# to create a new branch
git branch [name of your new branch]

# to push the new branch to a remote repository
git push origin [new-remote]

# to pull a new branch from a remote repository
git fetch origin [remote-branch]:[new-local-branch]

# git-pull and git-fetch are different because git-pull does a git-fetch 
# followed by a git-merge. You can do a "git fetch" at any time to update 
# your local copy of a remote branch. This operation never changes any of 
# your own branches and is safe to do without changing your working copy. 
# A "git pull" is what you would do to bring your repository up to date with 
# a remote repository.
