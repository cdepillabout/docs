" If you edit this, in order to reload it from a running
" firefox session, you can use a command like this.
" :source ~/.vimperatorrc

" go across tabs like vim tabs
map <C-h> gT
map <C-l> gt

" reorder tabs like vim
nnoremap <C-y> :tabmove -1<CR>
map <C-u> :tabmove +1<CR>

" scroll up and down faster
nnoremap k 4<C-y>
nnoremap j 4<C-e>
" these could also be done with something like this
" :noremap j 3j
" :noremap k 3k

" give an easy way to scroll up
map b <PageUp>

" make zooming easier
map x zi
map c zo

" this is a hack because the author thought to make the 
" minimum width of tabs REALLY small.  He says he will
" change it back, so this hack may not be needed in the future
