# there are A LOT of cool tricks here:
# https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit
# Or maybe using something like this:
# https://github.com/dholm/voidwalker

# set the output to be in intel style
set disassembly-flavor intel

# show us the asm window and registers window
# (these get messed up and are best turned on after debugging has started...)
#layout asm
#layout regs

# pretty-print c structures
set print pretty on
